> This repository is meant to be used as part of a training that includes additional content.

As a software engineer you sometimes need to make sure that the basics of “project management” are fulfilled. We are not talking about being a full time Project Manager, but rather the minimum number of tasks that you sometimes need to take on.

During this session you’ll be put into a fictive situation where you’ll be the first person “on the crime scene” and therefor the one that need to setup the tools needed for the rest of the crew to be able to work efficiently.

> Compared to previous Lightning Hacks, there will be no differences in difficulty level, but rather slight loose instructions to follow and try for everyone. The experience in real life will be very different from time to time and team to team, so having time and test out various features yourself will help you be ready to adopt and setup a custom version in real life.

> This does mean that not all instructions are detailed to every “click”, but you rather must think, test and figure out how to do a few steps. Your instructor is ready to answer any questions.

Instructions can be found [here](docs/instructions.md). Good luck and enjoy!
